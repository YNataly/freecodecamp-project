            <li><strong>1989</strong> - while working at at CERN (the largest internet node in Europe), proposed a global hypertext project to join hypertext with the internet, to be known as the World Wide Web</li>
            <li><strong>1990 to 1991</strong> - wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd", and the first client, "WorldWideWeb" a what-you-see-is-what-you-get hypertext browser/editor </li>
            <li><strong>1991 and 1993</strong> - continued working on the design of the Web, His initial specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined and discussed as the Web technology spread</li>
            <li><strong>1994</strong> - founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since that time he has served as the Director of the W3C</li>

            <h3>Difference between the Internet and the Web </h3>
                <h4>(from <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#What1" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee's FAQ page</a>)</h4></header>
         
            <ul>
                <li>The Internet ('Net) is a network of networks. Basically it is made from computers and cables.</li>
                <li> Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn  figured out how this could be used to send around little "packets" of information. 
                    They defined the "Internet Protocol" (IP) and "Transmission Control Protocol" (TCP), by which packets are sent on from one computer to another until they reach their destination. 
                </li>
                <li><blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#What1">
    The DESIGN of Internet was done in 1973 and published in 1974.
    There ensued about 10 years of hard work, resulting in the roll out of Internet in 1983.
</blockquote></li>
                <li>Paul Mockapetris  had figured out the Domain Name System (DNS).</li>
                <li class="q"><q cite="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids.html#invent">I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and -- ta-da! -- the World Wide Web. </q>, &mdash;Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
                <li> Web provides a way to retrieve and access documents on the Internet.</li>
                <li><blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Internet">
    The Web is an abstract (imaginary) space of information.
    On the Net, you find computers -- on the Web, you find document, sounds, videos,.... information.
                    On the Net, the connections are cables between computers; on the Web, connections are hypertext links. 
                    The Web exists because of programs which communicate between computers on the Net.
                    The Web could not be without the Net.
                    The Web made the net useful because people are really interested in information (not to mention knowledge and wisdom!) 
                    and don't really want to have know about computers and cables.</blockquote></li>
